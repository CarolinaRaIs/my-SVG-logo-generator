## [Description:](#description)

      The SVG Logo Generator is a command-line application that allows users to generate custom logos using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can specify the shape, color, and text for their logo. With just a few clicks, users can create professional-looking logos for various purposes.

    The application utilizes the following technologies and frameworks so that the application can deliver a seamless logo generation experience:

    JavaScript: The application is built using JavaScript, the programming language of the web, which enables dynamic and interactive features.

    Node.js: Node.js is used as the runtime environment for the application, allowing server-side execution of JavaScript code.

    Express.js: Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of web applications. It is used to handle routing and serve the application's endpoints.

    Inquirer: Inquirer is a command-line interface (CLI) library for Node.js that provides an interactive interface for collecting user input. It is used in the application to prompt users for logo details.

    SVG-Captcha: The SVG-Captcha library is utilized to generate SVG images containing the specified text for the logo. It provides options for customizing the appearance of the generated images, such as size, noise, color, and background.

    File System (fs): The fs module is a built-in module in Node.js that allows interaction with the file system. It is used to write the generated SVG logo to a file on the server.

    Jest: Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications. It is used in the project to write and execute test cases for the various components and functionalities of the application.
